# get_DNAnexus_URLs


Clinical Scietists reported that they could not view the mappped files in the IGV browser easily. 

Therefore, get_DNAnexus_URLs was created to speed up the process

This code is written to generate .csv containing URLs for index and BAM files located on the DNAnexus for use in the IGV browser. 

The code is to be run every day to refresh the .csv file with udate information

The URLs are generated for files created within the last 12 weeks (3 months). This length can be easily modified within the script.
